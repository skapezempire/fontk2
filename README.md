Custom fonts- TTF and OTF
Hello 🌎,
In 2012, I made sketches of my fonts fosu'Corinth A, fosu'sCorinth B and meteor.

fosu'Corinth A & B were inspired by an art subject I studied in high school; where we learnt about the arts of the Egyptians, including hieroglyphics and Greek arts.

Inspired by the Egyptian lettering, hieroglyphs, Greek architecture; the pillars/columns, and my constant seeing of the influence of Greek architecture in the pillar/column designs of new houses in Spintex(Ghana), I created fosu'Corinth A & B. These fonts were born out of lots of trials, and finally, in May 2024, I finalized the digital form of the fonts suitable for public use.

Moreover, Meteor was inspired by a fast glowing object I saw one night, cutting through the skies for a protracted length before varnishing. It had fire-like glows in pink, purple, and orange trailing behind it. So I believe I had seen a meteorite 🤷🏽‍♀, hence the creation of the Font, Meteor, with some cutouts suggesting flames.

Also, FontMeyRAR was invented last year when I was trying to design a logo for my #augmented reality product,MeyRAR(dedicated to my aunty).
It started as just an (M & R), and then soon, I found myself coming up with a blueprint to create a complete set of MeyRAR alphabets🤓.

You can kindly share what you make with these fonts.

Kindly note that these fonts are decorative fonts and come as TTF(True Type Font) and OTF(Open Type Font)files, suitable for modern digital platforms(photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft doc, including anywhere TTF/OTF files are supported.
